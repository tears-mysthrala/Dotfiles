feat: Complete migration to Linux-native shell configuration

- Replaced PowerShell scripts with POSIX-compliant shell scripts
- Added Makefile-based installation system with multi-distro support
- Implemented automatic package manager detection (apt, dnf, pacman, etc.)
- Added modern CLI tools integration:
  * Starship (cross-shell prompt)
  * Zoxide (smart directory navigation)
  * FZF (fuzzy finder)
  * Eza (modern ls replacement)
  * Bat (cat with syntax highlighting)
- Created modular shell configuration:
  * aliases.sh - Common shortcuts and tool aliases
  * functions.sh - System updates, git helpers, utilities
  * exports.sh - Environment variables and PATH configuration
- Added bootstrap installer (install.sh) with auto-detection
- Ported all PowerShell aliases and functions to Bash/Zsh equivalents
- Updated documentation for Linux environment
- Added migration guide and enhanced installation docs

BREAKING CHANGE: This removes all PowerShell-specific code and Windows
compatibility. The repository is now exclusively for Linux-based systems.

Files added:
- Makefile (orchestrates installation)
- install.sh (bootstrap script)
- cleanup-legacy.sh (removes PowerShell files)
- dotfiles/shell/aliases.sh
- dotfiles/shell/functions.sh
- dotfiles/shell/exports.sh
- MIGRATION.md (migration guide)

Files removed:
- Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
- powershell.config.json
- Core/ (all PowerShell modules)
- Scripts/ (PowerShell scripts)
- tools/*.ps1, tools/*.bat

Legacy features ported:
✓ Navigation shortcuts (.. ... .3 .4 .5)
✓ Editor detection and lazy loading
✓ Modern tool aliases (eza, bat, zoxide, fzf)
✓ Git shortcuts and helpers
✓ System update function (multi-distro)
✓ Cleanup utilities
✓ Archive extraction
✓ Network utilities (pubip, myip)
✓ Process management helpers
